% If you have 2 images that you want to run the "HD_change" code on, you need to get them to be binary and same size 
% This code allows you to read in the image you want to comare
% ALl of BL's letters that we are comparing to are [105,105] matrix so we want ours to be the same size
% Our images are also flipped when they come out of Drawcopy so we need to flip them 
% HD_change takes in itest and itrain 

itest = imread('yourimage.png')
itrain = imread('Brendens_image.png')
ML8 = flipud(itset)
itest = imrotate(ML8, 270)
itest = imresize(itest, [105,105])


%Now run HD_change(itest,itrain)
% To see the images overlapped try:
% A = imfuse(itest,itrain)
% imshow(A)
